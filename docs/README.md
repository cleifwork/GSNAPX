# GSnapX: Photo ID Layout Automation Desktop App

GSNAPX is a Python-based desktop application designed to streamline the process of preparing photo IDs for printing. The app automatically transforms a 2x2 photo ID into multiple copies of various standard photo sizes, such as 2x2, 1x1, and passport-sized photos, depending on the selected package. It optimally arranges the chosen set on A4-sized paper to minimize waste and reduce printing costs.

## Key Features:

**Automatic Photo ID Generation:**
- Single Source Image: Start with a single 2x2 original image.
- Multiple Output Sizes: Generate multiple photo IDs in different sizes (2x2, 1x1, and passport size).
- Customizable Selection: Choose the specific sizes you need, depending on the user selection.

## Key Features:
### Multiple Size Packages:
- Users can select from different packages with a single click:

### Automatic Layout Optimization:
- Dynamically arranges photos to maximize the use of A4 photo paper space.
- Ensures efficient printing by reducing wasted areas, resulting in cost savings on photo paper.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Simple button-based package selection, making it easy for users to choose the desired layout.
- Provides a preview of the layout before printing to ensure the arrangement meets expectations.

### Supports Standard Photo Sizes:
- 2x2 inches (50.8 x 50.8 mm)
- 1x1 inch (25.4 x 25.4 mm)
- Passport size (typically 2x2 inches but depends on the countryâ€™s specification)

### Photo Paper Optimization:
> GSANPX intelligently places images to allow easy cutting after printing, ensuring all photo IDs fit perfectly on A4 paper (8.27 x 11.69 inches).

### How GSNAPX Saves Cost:
1. Optimized Paper Use: With precise arrangements, fewer sheets of photo paper are required.
2. Fewer Mistakes: Automated layout generation reduces errors caused by manual arrangements.
3. Multiple Sizes in One Print: Allows printing different photo sizes in a single run, eliminating the need for separate prints.

### Ideal For:
- Photo studios preparing ID photos in bulk.
- Government offices and businesses needing passport or visa photos.
- Individuals printing their own photos for personal use.

> GSNAPX offers a fast, reliable way to create professional photo layouts without requiring manual adjustments. With its Python-based automation, it ensures both efficiency and cost-effectiveness for users who frequently print photo IDs.
